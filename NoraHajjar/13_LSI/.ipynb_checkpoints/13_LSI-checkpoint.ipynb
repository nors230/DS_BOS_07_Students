    "# Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)  \n",
    "LSI is a specific application of dimensionality reduction to the problem of unstructured text processing.\n",
    "  \n",
    "At it's core LSI uses a simple Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on a term-document matrix to perform the dimensionality reduction and map all documents and terms into one shared feature space.  This allows for pairwise conceptual comparison (by simple cosine similarity) of any documents or terms (term-term, term-document, document-document).  The higher the cosine similarity between two terms (or documents), the closer they are in terms of semantic or conceptual meaning.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "While the dimensionality reduction idea and term frequency vectors are not new, in it's 26 years of existence LSI has added considerable tradecraft making it (in this author's opinion) the state of the art technique for unstructured text analytics.  "
