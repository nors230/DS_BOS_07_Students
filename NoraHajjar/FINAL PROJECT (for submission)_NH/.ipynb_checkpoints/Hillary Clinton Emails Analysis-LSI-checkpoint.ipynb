The themes I stress are these: the importance of Berlin and the Brandenburg\\nGate as symbols of freedom; the weight of history (always felt by Germans); the contribution of the US and the salience\\nof the Western alliance; the meaning of 1989 to today and especially the continuity of the Western alliance; and segue\\nfrom past to future.\\nWhat I have not done here but might be added are references to Angela Merkel (a courageous woman from the east\\nwho embodies the highest values of the West); and specific policies. Those can be fitted in.\\nSo, some ideas and language:\\nTwenty years ago the wall fell. Here, in Berlin, the moment when tens of thousands of citizens tore it down with\\nhammers and picks and bare hands is called \"Die Wende,\" a phrase that means more than simply a change but a turning\\npoint in history. It was not only a turning point for Germany and Europe but also for the United States because the\\nwall—the reason for its construction and the reason for its destruction—is central to our common history—and to our\\ncommon future.\\nRichard von Weizsaecker said, \"As long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed, the German question will remain open.\"\\nToday I can say with finality, the German question is closed, because the Brandenburg Gate is wide open! The gate is\\nopen, Europe is open, and our future together is open.\\nIn the forty years from the Berlin airlift to the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Atlantic partnership proved itself the most\\nsuccessful alliance for freedom in history. That alliance was, is and shall be the crowning achievement of American\\nforeign policy. And the German – American relationship has always served as its foundation. Our alliance represents the\\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765213 Date: 07/31/2015\\n\f",

Instead of a wall we\\nhave built a gateway to the future. President Kennedy said in 1963 that in the future free men everywhere will say, \"Ich\\nbin ein Berliner.\" Today Berlin has gained a new and even more powerful meaning. Forever into the future, the opening\\nof this Gate will be the symbol of the return of the dream of freedom, not only to Berlin and Germany, but to the entire\\nworld.\\nThe Gate, we must remember, was not built as a symbol of freedom. And each of the tyrannies that used the Gate as a\\nsymbol believed it represented their eternal power. The Gate was first erected as a symbol against the French\\nRevolution; then it became a symbol of the imperial ambitions of Napoleon who marched his army through. It was a\\nsymbol of Prussian militarism and monarchy. It was seized by the Nazi Party as the symbol of its 1000 year rule. And\\nthen it became a symbol of the Communist totalitarianism that built a wall to separate the people of Berlin as though\\nfreedom could be contained in only one part of the city. Here, in Berlin, the Cold War was coldest.\\nWe celebrate the fact that the wall that marred this proud city was taken down by the world's most enthusiastic\\nwrecking crew. The United States always believed in the freedom of Berlin because we believed in the future of\\nfreedom. The courageous citizens of East Germany, Poland and other nations of the Communist bloc demonstrated their\\ndedication to free and peaceful solution of conflicts through their stand against dictatorship. America stood resolutely as\\nan ally at every moment of this struggle and moved swiftly to help the peoples of Europe reunite after 1989.\\nWe celebrate the steadiness of purpose, the restraint and respect for ultimate goals that allowed the Cold War to end in\\npeace. For how the victory was won was essential to the triumph. 1989 was special. It was that rarest of historical\\nevents: a revolution that did not descend into violence. As a result the Gate survives not as a cautionary monument to\\nhistory's darkest moments but to its brightest. Today we celebrate the revolution of 1989, the turning point that\\ntransformed the Brandenburg Gate into the symbol of the hope of democracy and the promise of freedom.\\nBerliner Luft, the air of Berlin, has always been unique. I can feel and smell the spirit of freedom in your streets. The\\ngreat American poet Carl Sandburg called Berlin the Chicago of Europe. Chicago is where I was born and raised. I can\\nsense the same energy, openness and dedication to hard work in both great cities. Another Chicagoan, President Barack\\nObama, was drawn to Berlin last July, a city that he said made him feel like a citizen of the world and a citizen of the\\nfuture.\\nI was very proud to visit our new Embassy at the Brandenburg Gate, located exactly where the Wall used to run. Our\\npresence here will forever underscore our determination that the spark of freedom from this city in 1989 will help light\\nthe torches of freedom throughout the world.\\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765213 Date: 07/31/2015\\n\f",
       "UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765213 Date: 07/31/2015\\nThe revolution of 1989 did not mark the end of history. Having made history together, we are summoned to secure\\nfreedom for future generations. As vital at the beginning of the 21st century as it was in the last half of the 20th, the\\nWestern alliance is called to new tasks. The dreams of 1989 reached far—and have farther to reach. Old hatreds and\\nconflicts—in the Balkins, the Caucauses, in the Middle East, East Asia, and Africa—still simmer. We have much to\\ndemonstrate what we have learned from the last century. Without freedom, without the rule of law, without the\\nopportunity for people to support themselves and their families – without basic human rights-- anger, aggression and\\nviolence will prevail.\\nToday we are faced with difficult and often dangerous conflicts arising not from conflicts between nations but within\\nthem, conflicts exploited by zealots who make the false claim that violence will purify the world and open the gates of\\nheaven. Once zealots tried to use this Gate to symbolize that message. But through the courage and determination of\\nthe people of Berlin and their stalwart allies, this Gate now stands for a true revolution of the spirit. The long twilight\\nstruggle to tear down this wall to make Europe whole and free inspires us, in this new century, to help other peoples\\ngain the same measure of security, respect and progress.\\nWe need Berlin more than ever today. We need your courage, your fortitude, your commitment to the rights of men—\\nand women—we need your example. We are hardly at the end of the history of the West. Standing here, where a wall\\nonce stood but is no more, in the light from the Gate, we have learned from history's deepest lessons. Our alliance,\\nlinked by shared struggle, dedicated to the ideals of freedom and democracy, strong from the world we have built, now\\nfaces a new world of challenges. And we are ready to meet and conquer them. We know it has been done before. We\\nare free men—and women—and proud to say, We are all Berliners.\\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765213 Date: 07/31/2015\\n\f",

We\\nwill be sending forward an info memo later this afternoon. But in view of the Secretary's interest, I thought this note my\\nbe useful to pass on to her at some point during the day. We are also doing some press guidance.\\nRegards, Johnnie\\nMadam Secretary,\\nI know you are deeply concerned about reports of ongoing violence and attacks against women that have occurred in\\nGuinea-Conakry. I want to let you know what actions the Africa Bureau is taking to address this crisis.\\nI met with Guinean Foreign Minister Alexandre Cece Loua this morning at 9:00. I expressed our deep outrage at the\\nbrutal actions of Guinean security forces against protesters on September 28, which resulted in 157 deaths, hundreds\\nmore injured, and the widespread rape of women. I will separately provide you with a formal readout of the meeting. I\\nhave also sent one of my Deputies, Bill Fitzgerald, to Conakry, where he met yesterday with President Dadis Camara and\\nexpressed the same outrage.\\nWe are pressing the government to take immediate actions to stop the violence and to restore constitutional order. We\\nhave asked Dadis Camara to step aside and to seek exile in Morocco or another French-speaking country. We have also\\nasked Guinea to invite in observers from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to monitor the\\nactions of the military and developments toward a democratic transition. In addition, we have indicated that we will\\nseek an international investigation in order to arrest and punish the perpetrators of the violence.\\nWe have indicated that if the Government of Guinea does not act rapidly, we will pursue sanctions against government\\nofficials. In all of these actions, we are consulting with the French, whose views and actions closely mirror ours, as well\\nas with several west African states, including Liberia and Senegal.\\nRegards, Johnnie\\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764296 Date: 07/31/2015\\n\f",

Beirne, S.J.\\nDear Trustees and Trustee Associates,\\nI am writing to share an update on Fr. Beirne's health. Fr. Beirne called this morning to let me know that his cancer has\\nreached a stage where he has made the decision not to have any further clinical intervention. He prefers to live out the\\ntime he has remaining, six months by the doctors' projections, without the sapping of his energy and other side effects\\nposed by his recent treatments. I have his permission to share this sad news with you. You may write to Fr. Beirne at\\nMurray-Weigel Hall where he is now living (see address below) or phone him on his cell phone at\\nMurray-Weigel Hall\\n515 E. Fordham Road\\nBronx, NY 10458-5029\\nI am sure that you join me in offering prayers for Fr. Beirne as he faces the challenges his illness presents in his final\\nmonths with us.\\nSincerely,\\nFred P.

What is most striking is that it\\naffirms that our analysis in the QDDR offers a set of questions that foreign ministries all over the world are grappling\\nwith. I had hoped to have time to do some traveling to broadcast the QDDR to key allies and partners around the world\\nafter the QDDR is in, but even if that can't happen, we will devise an outreach strategy re sending the report out to\\nforeign ministers around the world and to our ambassadors that will greatly amplify its impact.

Photograph: Julien Behal/PA\\nJustice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland> 's\\npower-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that \"opens a new chapter\" after\\ndecades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.\\nStanding alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the\\nprime minister said the \"inspirational\" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>\\nand the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.\\nThe deal —finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-\\ndeal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of\\nround-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.\\nIt will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans\\non overseeing parades.\\nBrown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of \"a new spirit of mutual\\nco-operation and respect\".\\nThe deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing\\nexecutive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including\\nthe abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.\\nA cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers\\nare devolved from London on 12 April.\\nBrown told reporters: \"The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement\\nbelongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This\\nis the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of\\ntalks, weeks of stalemate.\"\\nCowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making \"fair and balanced compromises\" to bridge the divisions and\\nsaid the quality of the negotiations meant that the \"devolved institutions can and will work\".\\nThe Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have\\nlaunched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal\\nwould \"absolutely\" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.\\nThe DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement \"will be more enduring because of the time spent\" in forming it.\\nReferring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit\\nat the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as\\n\"yet another very good Friday\".\\nJeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.\\nBut the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up\\nlegislation to change the way parades are judged.\\nA UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two\\ngovernments. \"We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it,\" she said.\\nThe talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in\\nthe near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last\\nthree years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led\\nby the two parties.\\nThe agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said\\nthe basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.\\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767378 Date: 08/31/2015\\n\f",

Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give\\nunionists enough concessions.\\nRobinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.\\n\"We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in\\nNorthern Ireland and to the community.\\n\"An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we\\nbelieve this can be the basis for gaining that confidence.\"\\nHowever the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had\\nchanged their minds.\\n\"The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on,\" Allister said.\\nThe DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the\\ndeal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.\\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767378 Date: 08/31/2015\\n\f",

Killion reports that candidates Baki (Ecuador) and Bukova (Bulgaria) met Sunday night Paris time.\\nBaki has given Bukova an ultimatum. Either they form a unity ticket with Ivonne Baki on top or Baki leaves the race.\\nTonight former Ferrero-Waldner supporters are considering how to vote. Mexican Dep Secretary for 10 issues called\\nme. They are wondering whether to support Baki in round 4 now that F-W is out.\\nI noted that we wanted the strongest of the ladies to stay in (Fyi, they both were on our list of the most qualified\\ncandidates.) Too early a pull out could also affect the race.\\nThe Egyptian candidate could lose because of a consolidation of alternative candidates.\\nI am sorry to report that the Egyptians have used harsh tactics in the halls of UNESCO. A member of the U.S. delegation\\nhas seen a member of the Egyptian-hired \"public relations\" group walking around with an envelope of cash. They\\npushed to have two Amb recalled. Disgust and resentment is running high.\\nThe Egyptians are pushing delegations very hard. FM Aboul-Gheit has stopped in Paris to deal with the UNESCO race\\nwhile en route to NY for UNGA.\\nA/S Feltman writes that Egyptian Ambassador Shoukry has called him twice todaY with a \"message from the Foreign\\nMinister.\" FM Aboul Gheit is angry and reports President Mubarak is angry.\\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759763 Date: 06/30/2015\\n\f",

He asked me today if I thought it would be appropriate for\\nhim to seek to see the Secretary to share some of his thoughts on Africa and current issues being confronted there. I\\ntold him of course and suggested that he reach out to you to try to arrange that dialogue. Hopefully that is ok from your\\nperspective. Andy is a thoughtful, remarkable and decent man.

       "UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762816 Date: 06/30/2015\\nI appreciated the opportunity to speak with you this past weekend regarding the custody case of Sean Goldman, the\\nyoung American boy wrongfully detained in Brazil for more than five years. As we discussed, the Administration has\\nlong maintained that Sean should be reunited with his father David in New Jersey. I have made a point of emphasizing\\nthis position with Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim during our many conversations, as have other U.S. Officials\\nwith their Brazilian counterparts.\\nWe have worked closely with the Government of Brazil to ensure it upholds its obligations under the Hague Convention\\non International Child Abduction. We were quite concerned by last week's decision suspending the order reuniting Sean\\nwith his father. We were encouraged, however, by the appeal filed last Friday by the Brazilian Solicitor General which\\nchallenges this suspension. Like you, we are eager to learn of the outcome of this appeal. We understand a decision\\ncould be announced shortly.\\nYou can be assured that we will continue advocating for the reunification of Sean and his father and pressing the\\nGovernment of Brazil to ensure swift consideration of the Goldman case so that this long legal process may reach a final\\nconclusion without further delay.

Photograph: Julien Behal/PA\\nJustice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland>'s\\npower-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that \"opens a new chapter\" after\\ndecades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.\\nStanding alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the\\nprime minister said the \"inspirational\" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>\\nand the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.\\nThe deal — finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-\\ndeal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of\\nround-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.\\nIt will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans\\non overseeing parades.\\nBrown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of \"a new spirit of mutual\\nco-operation and respect\".\\nThe deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing\\nexecutive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including\\nthe abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.\\nA cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers\\nare devolved from London on 12 April.\\nBrown told reporters: \"The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement\\nbelongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This\\nis the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of\\ntalks, weeks of stalemate.\"\\nCowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making \"fair and balanced compromises\" to bridge the divisions and\\nsaid the quality of the negotiations meant that the \"devolved institutions can and will work\".\\nThe Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have\\nlaunched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal\\nwould \"absolutely\" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.\\nThe DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement \"will be more enduring because of the time spent\" in forming it\\nReferring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit\\nat the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as\\n\"yet another very good Friday\".\\nJeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.\\nBut the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up\\nlegislation to change the way parades are judged.\\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773266 Date: 08/31/2015\\n\f",
       "UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773266 Date: 08/31/2015\\nA UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two\\ngovernments. \"We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be.signing up to it,\" she said.\\nThe talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in\\nthe near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last\\nthree years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led\\nby the two parties.\\nThe agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said\\nthe basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.\\nRobinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the\\nproposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give\\nunionists enough concessions.\\nRobinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.\\n\"We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in\\nNorthern Ireland and to the community.\\n\"An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we\\nbelieve this can be the basis for gaining that confidence.\"\\nHowever the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had\\nchanged their minds.\\n\"The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on,\" Allister said.\\nThe DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the\\ndeal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.\\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773266 Date: 08/31/2015\\n\f",
